# Make plots with Matplotlib

Create a python program called make plots.py that does the following:  

• read bikes.csv and DOX.csv into pandas dataframes  
• divide a matplotlib figure into 3 rows and 2 columns of subplots  
• make a pie chart of the statuses of the bikes  
• make a histogram of the prices of the bikes  
• make a scatter plot of the price vs. the weight of each bike  
• make a time-series plot of the price of the DOX stock price  
• make a box plot showing the range of prices for each brand  
• make a violin plot showing the range of prices for each brand  
• save the entire figure into a file called plots.png
